# Estimation Game

This is a card game that is built based on Java Swing. 

It is an interactive single player game that brings endless joy!

# Running the game
run compile.bat and run.bat files

Currently, run.bat runs from out folder as we are unable to figure out how to compile intellij's GUI Deisgner.

### Disclaimer on why run.bat runs from out instead of classes.
run_2.bat is the file that is supposed to run the game. It does not work on all three of our computers as we keep getting NullPointerException for all form objects. We have included the lib/forms_rt.jar but kept encountering this error. 

# Running tests
run compile_test.bat and run_test.bat files
